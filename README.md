# Streaming-Service-Analysis

There is a lot of competition between all the major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. In this project, I am going to do a short analysis on the best streaming service with some Python data visualization packages.

By using the plots in our notebook we can observe that:
- Netflix and Prime Video shows have higher IMDb ratings
- Amazon Prime performs very well in the fourth quadrant. 
- Hulu has some shows with the lowest rating
- A lot of Disney+ shows have higher rating on IMDb scale than on Rotten Tomatoes scale
